This guide will walk you through the design and deployment of a data pipeline architecture on Railway.app, a cloud-native development platform that allows you to quickly spin up backend infrastructure with minimal configuration overhead.\nThe goal of this pipeline is to collect, structure, and expose data in a way that supports meaningful analysis and knowledge generation. By combining unstructured and structured data from multiple services into a single relational data model, this system enables real-time insights via a customizable dashboard and a developer-friendly REST API."
